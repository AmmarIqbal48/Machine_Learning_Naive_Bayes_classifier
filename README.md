# Data preprocessing, Build a Naive Bayes classifier and Make the classifier robust to missing data with Laplace (additive) smoothing.

# INTRODUCTION:
Naive Bayes is an algorithm for classification based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem with an assumption of independence
among predictors. This is a MATLAB implementation of its behaviour. Laplace smoothing is applied. In statistics,
classification is the problem of identifying the category of an observation, based on a training set of data with
observations already classified. The classifiers implement a classification algorithm, that maps input data to a
category y.
